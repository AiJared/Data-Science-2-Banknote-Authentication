# Data-Science-2-Banknote-Authentication
A data science project for detecting fake bank notes

This project classifies banknotes in classes of genuine and fake notes.

A model is trained to detect fake notes from genuine notes.

The dataset used here is the banknote Authentication dataset from kaggle. This dataset contains features extracted from wavelet transformed images of both fake and genuine notes.

These features are

. Variance of the wavelet transformed image

. Skewness of the wavelet transformed image

. kurtosis of the wavelet transformed image

. entropy of the wavelet transformed image and 

. classes based on the above features
